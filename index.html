    <p class="igisoro">It is believed that the game of Morabaraba evolved in Africa thousands of years ago when it was taught to young herd boys using lines in the ground and stones of different colours.

       The idea was to teach them strategic skills when dealing with cattle and, even today, the playing pieces are still known as 'cows'. Morabaraba has also migrated to the west where it is better known as the board game of Twelve or Eleven Men's Morris.

    <p>

        The rules of Morabarbara at first seem a bit complicated, but bear in mind the game is played by young children and herd boys, so you'll pick them up fairly quickly!  There are two players with each having twelve 'cows' of differing colours. The first stage of the game involves placing these cows on the Morabarbara board.<br><br>

Each player in turn places a cow on one of the empty intersections of the board, with the aim being to get three cows of the same colour lined up to create a 'mill'. These mills can go in a any direction and when achieved, the player who has successfully created a mill can 'shoot' one of his or her opponent's cows which is then out of the game and removed from the Morabarbara board.<br><br>

The only exception to this rule is that a cow cannot be shot if its in a mill itself, unless all the player's cows are in mills in which case they're all targets. When a cow has been shot its the end of the turn and the opponent's turn to move a cow to a free location in an attempt to create a mill and thereby shoot an opponent's cow.<br><br>

There are two ways to win the game. Firstly, if the opponent can't make a move, and secondly if the opponent has only two cows left. The rules also state that if each player only has three cows left and neither can shoot one of their opponent's cows in ten turns, then its a draw.

         Ghana is historically famous for its gold - It was previously called the Gold Coast. Now, Chocolate has probably taken over, with it being one of the key suppliers of Cocoa to the likes of Cadbury's.

       <p class="ampe">Ampe is a simple but energy-driven game played by school-age children. It originated from Ghana and also played in other neighbouring countries.

          It is played by two or more people and requires no equipment.</p>

           For<strong> Ampe </strong>the leader and another player jump up at the same time, clap, and thrust one foot forward when they jump up. If the leader and the other player have the same foot forward the leader wins a point. 

           If they are different than the other player becomes "it" and plays against the remaining players. If the players are in a circle, the leader moves along the inside of the circle, playing against others in turn.

          If they are in a line, the leader moves on down the line. If only two players are playing, they keep score until a certain number of points determines a winner. </p>

    <p class="ampe">Pilolo is an outdoor game that is usually played among Ghanaian children. The literal English translation of the name is "time to search for". The Pilolo game is played by two or more children. The higher the number, the increase in excitement and zeal to win. An object like a stick is mostly used and the number of sticks to use is dependent on the number of children.
